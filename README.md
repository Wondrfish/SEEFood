🍔 Food Classifier with TensorFlow & Keras
A deep learning model for food image classification using TensorFlow and Keras. The model is trained on the Food-101 dataset and supports additional custom datasets.

🚀 Features
✅ Deep Learning Model using CNN
✅ Food-101 Dataset Integration
✅ Data Augmentation for Better Accuracy
✅ Saves Model (.h5 file) for Future Use
✅ Custom Datasets Supported

📂 Dataset Structure
Ensure the dataset is structured properly before training:
/food_dataset/
  /pizza/
    - img1.jpg
    - img2.jpg
  /burger/
    - img1.jpg
    - img2.jpg
  /apple/
    - img1.jpg
    - img2.jpg

If using Food-101, ensure an 80-20 train-validation split.

🛠️ Installation
Step 1: Clone the Repository
git clone https://github.com/your-username/Food-Classifier.git
